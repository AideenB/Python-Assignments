# Programming & Scripting Module - Python-Assignments

### This is a list of the weekly assignments that I've completed as part of this module that are contained in this repository.

1. exercise1+2.py <br>
*Weeks 1 and 2 Assignments compiled together where the first and last letters of my first name were converted to corresponding numbers from the Fibonacci sequence and then added together, along with an exercise where a provided Python script was modified to return the Fibonacci number for the first and last letters of my last name ("b" and "e") and also* 

2. collatz.py <br>
*This file contains a Python script that starts with an integer and applies the Collatz function (divide by 2 if even, multiply by three and 1 if odd) repeatedly using a while loop and if statement. The starting value is 17 and at each iteration, the current value of the integer is printed to the screen.*

3. euler5.py <br>
*This program is written to prove [problem set number 5 from Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5). This problem posits that 2,520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. The program uses for and range to calculate the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20.*

4. iris.py <br>
*This code uses [Ronald Fisher's Iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) in a .csv file that is opened in Python and prints the four numerical values on each row (petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width)with decimal places aligned and a space between the columns.*


5. factorial.py <br>
*This exercise consists of a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) This script also tests the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.*
